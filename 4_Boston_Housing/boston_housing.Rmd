This is a R Markdown Document for the Udacity Boston Housing Project.

## Getting Started

First step is to import the data

```{r}
library(here)
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(dplyr))

# Import Data
data <- read.csv(here('4_Boston_Housing/housing.csv'))

# Load the datasets
prices <- data$MEDV
features <- data %>%
  select
glimpse(data)
```

## Data Exploration

### Calculate Statistics

Rather that calculate summary stats separately, we can do so with two lines in
R

```{r}
library(scales)
summary(prices) 
paste0("Standard Deviation: ", dollar(sd(prices)))
```
