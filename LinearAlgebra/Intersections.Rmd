# Notebook for Linear Algebra - Intersections course on Udacity

Lines in Two Dimensions: 

Two pieces of info define a line, basepoint $\vec{x}_0$ and direction
vector $\vec{v}$

All points represented by form $\vec{x}(t) = \vec{x}_0 + t\vec{v}$
 with infinitely many basepoints and direction vectors.
 
 Give $y = mx +v$ m is slope, b is y intercept. For every movement in the
 x direction there are m movements in the y direction.
 
 More general form is $A_x + B_y = k$
 
To reconstruct a basepoint: 

if $B \ne 0$ take $x=0$ to get $y = \frac{k}{B}$
if $A \ne 0$ take $y=0$ to get $x = \frac{k}{A}$
